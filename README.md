## Data Preparation  
- Cleaned and formatted raw income and expense data.  
- Standardized dates, categories, and amounts.  
- Structured the dataset for pivot table analysis.  

## Pivot Table Work  
- **All Expenses (PivotTable4):** Central table consolidating expenses.  
- **Total Spend by Account:** Account-level breakdown with totals.  
- **Expense by Category:** Category-wide spending patterns.  
- **Income vs Expenses:** Comparison of earnings against spend.  
- **Monthly Expense Trend:** Time-based income vs expense tracking.  

## Project Dashboard Design  
The dashboard combined different charts to tell a complete story:  

- **Total Spend by Account â€“ Doughnut Chart**  
  Quick view of where the most money is being spent.  

- **Expense by Category â€“ Waterfall Chart**  
  Clear breakdown of category-level spending.  

- **Income vs Expenses â€“ Bar Chart**  
  Direct comparison showing surplus or deficit.  

- **Monthly Expense & Income Trend â€“ Clustered Column Chart**  
  Month-to-month shifts in earnings vs spending.  

- **Expense by Subcategory â€“ Bar Chart**  
  Deeper look at specific spending types.  

*Interactive slicers* were added so users can filter by month, year, or category for a personalized view.  

## Project Insights  
- **Spending habits:** Dining Out and Transport made up the biggest expenses.  
- **Risks:** Certain months showed more spending than income.  
- **Opportunities:** Expense-to-income ratio was around **72%**, showing savings potential.

It shows where money comes from, where it goes, and how it changes over time.  
The clean design, interactive filters, and clear visuals make it practical for everyday financial decisions.
