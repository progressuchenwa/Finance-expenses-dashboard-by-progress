# Finance Expenses Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard Creating Using MS Excel)  

## Project Overview  
This project started with a messy dataset full of blanks, duplicates, and inconsistent formats. My task was to transform this raw financial data into a clean, structured, and interactive Excel dashboard that could tell a clear spending story.
I went step by step: cleaning the dataset, creating calculated fields to give meaning to expenses, and designing a wireframed layout before building the visuals. The end result is a dashboard that highlights where money is going, month after month, in a way thatâ€™s simple and easy to read.

## DataSet Used
[ðŸ“Š View dataset](https://github.com/progressuchenwa/Finance-expenses-dashboard-by-progress/blob/main/Finance%20Expenses%20Data.xlsx)

## Objective  
- The dashboard was designed to:
- Track income vs expenses across months.
- Break down spending by category and subcategory.
- Show the biggest expense drivers at a glance.
- Provide a structured story of how money is managed.
- Allow interactive filtering with slicers for deeper exploration.

## Finance Dashboard

## Data Preparation  
- Cleaned raw data: removed duplicates, fixed blanks, and standardized formats.
- Created a Calculated Metrics with new fields:
- Expense type (Fixed vs Variable)
- Expense priority (Needs vs Wants)
- Efficiency column to evaluate spending impact
- Built a People Table that personalized the dataset and used formulas like IFERROR to replace blanks with zero, keeping the tables professional and consistent.
- Structured the dataset for pivot table analysis. 

## Pivot Table Work  
- **All Expenses (PivotTable4):** Central table consolidating expenses.  
- **Total Spend by Account:** Account-level breakdown with totals.  
- **Expense by Category:** Category-wide spending patterns.  
- **Income vs Expenses:** Comparison of earnings against spend.  
- **Monthly Expense Trend:** Time-based income vs expense tracking.  

## Project Dashboard Design  
Before building the visuals, I created a wireframe to plan the layout. This step helped me decide:
- What the user should notice first.
- How the story should flow from total expenses down to details.
- The right charts for the right comparisons.

**The final dashboard included:**

- **Living Expenses Highlight**: showing the largest spending area ($19,442).

- **Discretionary & Transport**: the next highest categories.

- **Charity & Medical**: smaller but consistent categories.

- **Month-to-Month Trend**: reinforcing that living expenses dominate consistently.

- **Interactive slicers** : to filter by month, year, or category.

ðŸ‘‰ **Two clickable icons were added**:

- One links to the calculated metrics sheet.

- Another links to the dashboard slide view for easier storytelling.

*Interactive slicers* were added so users can filter by month, year.

## Why This Project Matters

Financial tracking is one of the most practical applications of data analysis. Businesses, nonprofits, and even households rely on dashboards like this to:

- Spot where money leaks are happening.

- Decide what categories to cut back on.

- Compare fixed vs variable costs for better budgeting.

- Make informed financial decisions at a glance.

This project shows not only technical Excel skills but also the ability to think like a decision-maker, turning rows of numbers into a clear financial story that supports smarter choices.

## Project Insights

- Living expenses dominated spending throughout the dataset.

- Discretionary and transport followed as the next major contributors.

- Smaller categories like charity and medical were steady but low.

- Spending trends repeated month after month, making it clear where adjustments could have the biggest impact.

## Conclusion

This project reinforced that cleaning and structuring data is where storytelling begins. By building calculated fields, standardizing entries, and wireframing before design, I was able to create a dashboard that flows naturally and highlights the story in seconds.

The finished dashboard doesnâ€™t just show numbers; it shows decisions.
